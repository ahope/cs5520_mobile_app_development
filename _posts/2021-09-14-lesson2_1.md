## link
[link to the code in my Github repo](https://github.com/sharonzidi/cs5520_mobile_app_development)


## Things I learned

- An Intent can be explicit or implicit:
```An explicit intent is one in which you know the target of that intent. That is, you already know the fully qualified class name of that specific activity.```
```An implicit intent is one in which you do not have the name of the target component, but you have a general action to perform.```

 An Intent is an asynchronous message that you can use in your activity to request an action from another activity, or from some other app component. You use an intent to start one activity from another activity, and to pass data between activities.
