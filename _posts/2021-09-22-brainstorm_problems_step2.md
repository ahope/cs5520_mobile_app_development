restaurant recommendations based on location and user requirements

Alex is a young software development engineer who works till late night in the office and have no time to make meal. He wants to find something to eat on the way home in a shorest time and also match his flavor.

* Trigger:
Alex opens the map to find resturants. Some of the restaurants are closed, some are not on his way home, some are not in his flavor. He spends about 20 minutes to make a selection, when he drive there, the waitress told him he have already passed the last call of order. Alex opens the map again to find another resrtaurant.

* Desired outcome:

I expect the use know his preference and demands so that the app could filter out some of the restaurants.
